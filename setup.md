## 3. Ingestion

Configure data connectors: left pane → Configuration → Data connectors → select the connector → Open connector page

> [!Tip]
>
> The connector `Status` changes to `Connected` after it's configured
>
> The `Last Log Received` timestamp and `Data received` timeline would show if there is actually data coming in
